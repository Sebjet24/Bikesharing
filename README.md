# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

### Purpose:

There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, I'll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
 - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
Finally, I’ll add these new visualizations to the two I created in this module for my final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
